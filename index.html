Ogirima Obey
Business Consultant
I founded Fund Bridge Africa with a single mission: to level the playing field for African entrepreneurs. I saw too many brilliant ideas fail simply due to a lack of access and strategic guidance.
With vast experience in navigating the complex world of grants, venture capital, and fellowships, I now dedicate my time to helping founders like you build the compelling applications and strategies needed to secure funding. Your vision deserves to be seen. Let's build the bridge to get it there.
